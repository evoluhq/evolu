# Comparison

This page compares Evolu with other local-first frameworks and solutions to help you make an informed decision about which tool best fits your needs.

The goal of Evolu is to be as simple, stable, and private as possible. It uses SQLite because SQL is a must for business apps, providing the query flexibility and reliability that production applications require.

**Note:** This page is currently in progress and will be updated with detailed comparisons soon.
