# Dependency Injection

Also known as "passing arguments"

## Intro

What is Dependency Injection? Someone once called it 'really just a pretentious way to say "taking an argument,"' and while it does involve taking or passing arguments, not every instance of that qualifies as Dependency Injection.

Some function arguments are local—say, the return value of one function passed to another—and often used just once. Others, like a database instance, are global and needed across many functions. Traditionally, when something must be shared across functions, we might export it from a module and let other modules import it directly:

```ts
// db.ts
export const db = createDb();

// user.ts
import { db } from "./db"; // 🚨 Direct import creates tight coupling
```

This turns `db` into a [service locator](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/), a well-known anti-pattern—other modules "locate" the service by importing it. The problem? It's hard to test (you can't easily swap `db` for a mock) and hard to refactor (every module that imports `db` is tightly coupled to that specific instance).

The alternative is to pass dependencies explicitly to where they're needed. But where do we create and wire them together? In a [Composition Root](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/)—a single place (typically your app's entry point) where all dependencies are instantiated and composed. From there, dependencies flow down through function arguments.

Some frameworks use sophisticated DI Containers (Inversion of Control containers) to manage dependencies automatically. Evolu prefers [Pure DI](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/06/10/pure-di/)—Dependency Injection using plain, idiomatic JavaScript without a container. All we need is a convention.

Imagine we have a function that does something with time:

```ts
// 🚨 Implicitly depends on global Date—a service we "locate" from global scope
const timeUntilEvent = (eventTimestamp: number): number => {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
};
```

This is better, but still not ideal:

```ts
const timeUntilEvent = (date: Date, eventTimestamp: number): number => {
  const currentTime = date.getTime();
  return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
};
```

- We are mixing function dependencies (`date`) with function arguments (`eventTimestamp`)
- Passing dependencies like that is tedious and verbose.
- We only need the current time, but we're using the entire `Date` instance (which is hard to mock).

We can do better. Let’s start with a simple interface:

```ts
/** Retrieves the current time in milliseconds, similar to `Date.now()`. */
export interface Time {
  readonly now: () => number;
}
```

Note we’re using an interface instead of a class. This is called "programming against interfaces."

<Note>
  Defining dependencies as interfaces rather than concrete implementations
  simplifies testing with mocks, enhances composition by decoupling components,
  and improves maintainability by allowing swaps without rewriting logic.
</Note>

Let's use the `Time` dependency:

```ts
// Currying splits dependencies from the function’s arguments
const timeUntilEvent =
  (time: Time) =>
  (eventTimestamp: number): number => {
    const currentTime = time.now();
    return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
  };
```

This is better, but what if we need another dependency, like a `Logger`?

```ts
export interface Logger {
  readonly log: (
    message?: unknown,
    ...optionalParams: ReadonlyArray<unknown>
  ) => void;
}
```

Passing multiple dependencies can get verbose:

```ts
const timeUntilEvent =
  (time: Time, logger: Logger) =>
  (eventTimestamp: number): number => {
    logger.log("...");
    const currentTime = time.now();
    return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
  };
```

This attempt isn’t ideal either:

```ts
// 🚨 Don't do that.
const timeUntilEvent =
  (deps: Time & Logger) =>
  (eventTimestamp: number): number => {
    deps.log("...");
    const currentTime = deps.now();
    return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
  };
```

The previous example isn't ideal because dependencies with overlapping property names would clash.
And we even haven’t yet addressed creating dependencies or making them optional. Long story short, let’s look at the complete example.

## Example

The example demonstrates a simple yet robust approach to Dependency Injection (DI) in TypeScript without relying on a DI Container. It calculates the time remaining until a given event timestamp using a `Time` dependency, with an optional `Logger` for logging. Dependencies are defined as interfaces (`Time` and `Logger`) and wrapped in distinct types (`TimeDep` and `LoggerDep`) to avoid clashes.

Factory functions (`createTime` and `createLogger`) instantiate these dependencies, and they’re passed as a single deps object to the `timeUntilEvent` function. The use of `Partial<LoggerDep>` makes the logger optional.

```ts
export interface Time {
  readonly now: () => number;
}

export interface TimeDep {
  readonly time: Time;
}

export interface Logger {
  readonly log: (
    message?: unknown,
    ...optionalParams: ReadonlyArray<unknown>
  ) => void;
}

export interface LoggerDep {
  readonly logger: Logger;
}

const timeUntilEvent =
  // Partial makes LoggerDep optional
  (deps: TimeDep & Partial<LoggerDep>) =>
    (eventTimestamp: number): number => {
      deps.logger?.log("Calculating time until event...");
      const currentTime = deps.time.now();
      return eventTimestamp - currentTime;
    };

/** Creates a {@link Time} using Date.now(). */
export const createTime = (): Time => ({
  now: () => Date.now(),
});

/** Creates a {@link Logger} using console.log. */
export const createLogger = (): Logger => ({
  log: (...args) => {
    console.log(...args);
  },
});

const enableLogging = true;

// Composition Root: where we wire all dependencies together
const deps: TimeDep & Partial<LoggerDep> = {
  time: createTime(),
  // Inject the dependency conditionally
  ...(enableLogging && { logger: createLogger() }),
};

timeUntilEvent(deps)(1742329310767);
```

As you can see, we don't need a framework with a DI Container (like Effect for example)—all we need is a convention.

Note that passing `deps` manually isn't as verbose as you might think:

```ts
export interface TimeDep {
  readonly time: Time;
}

export interface LoggerDep {
  readonly logger: Logger;
}

const runApp = (deps: LoggerDep & TimeDep) => {
  // Over-providing is OK—doSomethingWithTime needs only TimeDep,
  // but passing the whole `deps` object is fine
  doSomethingWithTime(deps);
  doSomethingWithLogger(deps);
};

const doSomethingWithTime = (deps: TimeDep) => {
  deps.time.now();
};

// Over-depending is not OK—this function requires TimeDep but doesn't use it
const doSomethingWithLogger = (deps: LoggerDep & TimeDep) => {
  deps.logger.log("foo");
};

type AppDeps = LoggerDep & TimeDep;

const appDeps: AppDeps = {
  logger: createLogger(),
  time: createTime(),
};

runApp(appDeps);
```

Remember:

- ✅ **Over-providing is OK**: A function requires `ADep`, but you provide `ADep & BDep`—just pass the whole `deps` object.
- 🚫 **Over-depending is not**: A function requires `ADep & BDep` but only uses `ADep`—keep dependencies lean.

The last thing you need to know is that factory functions can also be dependencies. Sometimes, we must delay creating a dependency until a prerequisite is available (e.g., a `Logger` needs a `Config` that’s not ready yet, like in a Web Worker).

A factory function as a dependency:

```ts
export interface LoggerConfig {
  readonly level: "info" | "debug";
}

export interface Logger {
  readonly log: (
    message?: unknown,
    ...optionalParams: ReadonlyArray<unknown>
  ) => void;
}

export type CreateLogger = (config: LoggerConfig) => Logger;

export interface CreateLoggerDep {
  readonly createLogger: CreateLogger;
}

export const createLogger: CreateLogger = (config) => ({
  log: (...args) => {
    console.log(`[${config.level}]`, ...args);
  },
});

type AppDeps = CreateLoggerDep & TimeDep;

// Note we pass `createLogger` as a factory, not calling it yet.
// It will be called later when LoggerConfig becomes available.
const appDeps: AppDeps = {
  createLogger,
  time: createTime(),
};

runApp(appDeps);
```

## Guidelines

- Start with an interface or type—everything can be a dependency.
- To avoid clashes, wrap dependencies (`TimeDep`, `LoggerDep`).
- Write factory functions (`createTime`, `createTestTime`).
- Both regular functions and factory functions accept a single argument named `deps`, combining one or more dependencies (e.g., `A & B & C`).
- Sort dependencies alphabetically when combining them, and place `Partial` deps last.

<Note>
  Never export a global instance from a shared module (e.g., `export const
  logger = createLogger()`). Other modules might import it directly instead of
  receiving it through proper DI, turning it into a [service
  locator](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern/)—a
  pattern that's hard to test and refactor. Creating instances at module scope
  is fine in the [Composition
  Root](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2011/07/28/CompositionRoot/), the application's
  entry point where dependencies are wired together.
</Note>

Btw, Evolu provides
[Console](/docs/api-reference/common/Console), so you probably
don't need a Logger.

## Error Handling

Dependencies often perform operations that can fail. Use the [`Result`](/docs/api-reference/common/Result/type-aliases/Result) type to make errors explicit and type-safe. The key principle: **expose domain errors, hide implementation errors**.

```ts
import { Result, ok, err } from "@evolu/common";

// Domain errors that callers care about
interface StorageFullError {
  readonly type: "StorageFullError";
}

interface PermissionError {
  readonly type: "PermissionError";
}

// ✅ Good: Dependency interface exposes domain errors
export interface Storage {
  readonly save: (
    data: Data,
  ) => Result<void, StorageFullError | PermissionError>;
}

export interface StorageDep {
  readonly storage: Storage;
}
```

The implementation maps internal errors to domain errors:

```ts
// ❌ Avoid: Leaking implementation error (SqliteError) through interface
export interface Storage {
  readonly save: (data: Data) => Result<void, SqliteError>;
}

// ✅ Good: Map implementation errors to domain errors
export const createStorage = (deps: SqliteDep): Storage => ({
  save: (data) => {
    const result = deps.sqlite.exec(/* ... */);
    if (!result.ok) {
      // Map SqliteError to a domain error
      if (result.error.code === "SQLITE_FULL") {
        return err({ type: "StorageFullError" });
      }
      return err({ type: "PermissionError" });
    }
    return ok();
  },
});
```

This approach keeps your domain logic decoupled from implementation details. You can swap SQLite for IndexedDB without changing the `Storage` interface or any code that depends on it.

### Testing Error Paths

With typed errors, testing failure scenarios is straightforward:

```ts
const createFailingStorage = (): Storage => ({
  save: () => err({ type: "StorageFullError" }),
});

test("handles storage full error", () => {
  const deps = { storage: createFailingStorage() };
  const result = saveUserData(deps)(userData);
  expect(result).toEqual(err({ type: "StorageFullError" }));
});
```

## Testing

Avoiding global state makes testing and composition easier. Here's an example with mocked dependencies:

```ts
const createTestTime = (): Time => ({
  now: () => 1234567890, // Fixed time for testing
});

test("timeUntilEvent calculates correctly", () => {
  const deps = { time: createTestTime() };
  expect(timeUntilEvent(deps)(1234568890)).toBe(1000);
});
```

Evolu provides [`createTestTime`](/docs/api-reference/common/Time/functions/createTestTime) out of the box—a `Time` implementation that returns monotonically increasing values, useful for tests that need predictable, ordered timestamps.

## Tips

### Merging Deps

Since deps are regular JS objects, you can spread them:

```ts
const appDeps: AppDeps = {
  ...fooDeps,
  ...barDeps,
};
```

### Optional Deps

Use `Partial` and conditional spreading to make deps optional:

```ts
const deps: TimeDep & Partial<LoggerDep> = {
  time: createTime(),
  // Inject the dependency conditionally
  ...(enableLogging && { logger: createLogger() }),
};
```

### Refining Deps

To reuse existing deps while swapping specific parts, use `Omit`. For example, if `AppDeps` includes `CreateSqliteDriverDep` and other deps, but you want to replace `CreateSqliteDriverDep` with `SqliteDep`:

```ts
export type AppDeps = CreateSqliteDriverDep & LoggerDep & TimeDep;

export type AppInstanceDeps = Omit<AppDeps, keyof CreateSqliteDriverDep> &
  SqliteDep;
```

To remove multiple deps, like `CreateSqliteDriverDep` and `LoggerDep`, use a union of keys:

```ts
export type TimeOnlyDeps = Omit<
  AppDeps,
  keyof CreateSqliteDriverDep | keyof LoggerDep
>;
```

### Handling Clashes

When combining deps with `&` (e.g., `LoggerDep & TimeDep`), property clashes are rare but possible. The fix is simple—use distinct wrappers:

```ts
export interface LoggerADep {
  readonly loggerA: LoggerA;
}

export interface LoggerBDep {
  readonly loggerB: LoggerB;
}
```

## FAQ

**What qualifies as a dependency?**

A dependency is anything that interacts with the outside world—like time (`Date`), logging (`console`), databases—or holds shared state, like [`Ref`](/docs/api-reference/common/Ref) and [`Store`](/docs/api-reference/common/Store). Regular function arguments are not dependencies because they are immutable—now you know why Evolu [recommends readonly objects](/docs/conventions#immutability).

```ts
interface CounterRefDep {
  readonly counterRef: Ref<number>;
}

const increment = (deps: CounterRefDep) => {
  deps.counterRef.modify((n) => n + 1);
};
```

<Note>
  Before reaching for DI, consider if you can restructure your code as an
  [impure/pure/impure
  sandwich](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/02/02/dependency-rejection/)—gather
  impure data first, pass it to pure functions, then perform impure effects with
  the result. This often eliminates the need for dependencies entirely.
</Note>

**Why shouldn't dependencies use generic arguments?**

Dependencies must not use generic type parameters—that would leak implementation details into domain logic and tightly couple consumers to specific implementations.

```ts
// ❌ Avoid: Generic parameter leaks implementation detail
interface Storage<Row> {
  query: (sql: string) => ReadonlyArray<Row>;
}

// Now every function using Storage must know about Row
const getUsers = (deps: { storage: Storage<UserRow> }) =>
  deps.storage.query("SELECT * FROM users");
```

The problem: `UserRow` might be SQLite-specific. If you switch to IndexedDB, the row shape could differ, breaking all code that depends on `Storage<UserRow>`.

```ts
// ✅ Good: No generic, implementation hidden
interface Storage {
  getUsers: () => Result<ReadonlyArray<User>, StorageError>;
}

// Consumer doesn't know or care how data is stored
const getUsers = (deps: StorageDep) => deps.storage.getUsers();
```

By hiding the generic, the `Storage` interface becomes implementation-agnostic. You can swap SQLite for IndexedDB without changing any code that depends on `Storage`.

**Key points:**

- **Decoupling:** Code remains agnostic to underlying implementation (SQLite, IndexedDB, in-memory, etc.)
- **Simplicity:** Consumers don't need to know implementation-specific types
- **Testability:** Easy to mock without matching generic parameters

See also [Error Handling](#error-handling) for related guidance on hiding implementation errors.
