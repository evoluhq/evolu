## What is the SQLite database size limit?

The size limit depends on the storage quotas and eviction criteria of the browser or platform in use. For detailed information, refer to the [Storage quotas and eviction criteria](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_API/Storage_quotas_and_eviction_criteria) documentation.

## How can I check the current database filesize?

Use `exportDatabase` method on Evolu instance.

```ts
const database = await evolu.exportDatabase();
const sizeInBytes = database.length;
console.log(`Database size: ${sizeInBytes} bytes`);
```

## How to delete OPFS Sqlite in browser?

To clear the OPFS (Origin Private File System) SQLite database:

1. Install the [OPFS Explorer Chrome DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/opfs-explorer/acndjpgkpaclldomagafnognkcgjignd)
2. Disable JavaScript in your browser
3. Reload the page
4. Open DevTools and navigate to the OPFS Explorer tab
5. Remove the SQLite database file
6. Re-enable JavaScript
7. Reload the page

## How do I create ORM-like relations (nest related rows in queries)?

Evolu uses [Kysely](https://kysely.dev/), the type-safe SQL query builder for TypeScript.

Kysely **is not** an ORM. It **does not** have the concept of relations. Kysely **is** a query builder—it builds the SQL you tell it to, nothing more, nothing less. However, there is a way to nest related rows in queries. It's described [here](https://kysely.dev/docs/recipes/relations), and Evolu supports it.

**TL;DR**: JSON type with subselects. With this combination, we can write efficient queries with nested relations. Evolu automatically parses stringified JSONs to typed objects and ensures that no regular strings are mistakenly parsed as JSON.

## How do I store device-specific settings that shouldn't sync?

Use a separate local-only Evolu instance with `transports: []` for device-specific settings like UI preferences, onboarding state, or account management flow:

```ts
const PreferencesId = id("Preferences");
type PreferencesId = typeof PreferencesId.Type;

const DeviceSchema = {
  preferences: {
    id: PreferencesId,
    // whatever
  },
};

// Local-only instance for device settings (no sync)
const deviceEvolu = createEvolu(evoluReactWebDeps)(DeviceSchema, {
  name: SimpleName.orThrow("MyApp-Device"),
  transports: [], // No sync - stays local to device
});
```

This approach gives us:

- **Type safety** with the same Evolu APIs
- **Schema evolution** for local settings
- **Reactive queries** for local state
- **Complete separation** from synced user data

## How do I store owner-specific data that shouldn't sync?

Tables prefixed with underscores (`_`) are local-only within an existing Evolu instance—they're never synced.

Imagine editing a JSON-rich text document. Syncing the entire document on every keystroke would be inefficient. Instead, save drafts to a local-only table first:

```ts
const Schema = {
  // Regular synced table
  document: {
    id: DocumentId,
    title: NonEmptyString1000,
    content: NonEmptyString,
  },
  // Local-only table (underscore prefix)
  _documentDraft: {
    id: DocumentId,
    title: NonEmptyString1000,
    content: NonEmptyString,
  },
};

// Save draft locally on every keystroke (no sync)
evolu.upsert("_documentDraft", {
  id: documentId,
  title,
  content,
});

// When ready to sync (e.g., on blur, route change)
evolu.update("_documentDraft", { id: documentId, isDeleted: true });
evolu.upsert("document", { id: documentId, title, content });
```

Evolu batches mutations in a microtask and runs them in a transaction, ensuring atomicity and no data loss. Saving to local-only tables won't block the main thread since Evolu uses Web Workers. In React Native, `InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions` will be used (coming soon).

## How do I integrate with external systems that have their own IDs?

Use `createIdFromString` to convert external IDs into valid Evolu IDs:

```ts
import { createIdFromString } from "@evolu/common";

// Convert external API ID to Evolu ID
const evoluId = createIdFromString("user-api-123");

upsert("todo", {
  id: evoluId,
  title: "Task from external system",
});

// With table branding for type safety
const todoId = createIdFromString<"Todo">("external-todo-456");
```

This ensures that multiple clients creating records with the same external identifier will generate the same Evolu ID.

**Important**: This transformation is one-way. If you need to preserve the original external ID, store it in a separate column.
