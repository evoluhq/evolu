# Evolu Relay

Evolu Relay provides sync and backup for Evolu apps. Evolu apps can use multiple relays simultaneously. For resilience, it's recommended to use two relays: a fast primary "home/company" relay (on‑prem or close to users) and a geographically distant secondary relay if the primary relay fails (hardware failure, network issues, etc.).

Evolu apps can combine self‑hosted relays with cloud relays. Evolu Relay is stateless, so it can run in any serverless cloud environment (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, etc.), allowing Evolu apps to work even when major cloud providers go down.

Direct peer‑to‑peer (P2P) sync between clients is technically possible and on our roadmap; implementation awaits additional local transports like Bluetooth, Wi‑Fi, LAN, etc.

## Hosting Evolu Relay

The Evolu Relay source code, along with the Docker files, can be found at [github.com/evoluhq/evolu/tree/main/apps/relay](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu/tree/main/apps/relay).

<Note>
  We provide a free `free.evoluhq.com` relay for testing, but no hosting because
  it's not Evolu's mission to compete with established clouds (yet). Our plan
  for Evolu is different: We will sell Evolu apps, Evolu HW devices, and provide
  paid support.
