# Get started with the library

This guide will get you up and running with Evolu Library.

<Note>
  Requirements: `TypeScript 5.7` or later with the `strict` flag enabled in
  `tsconfig.json` file.
</Note>

## Installation

```bash
npm install @evolu/common
```

## Learning path

We recommend learning Evolu Library in this order:

### 1. Result – Error handling

Start with [`Result`](/docs/api-reference/common/Result/type-aliases/Result), which provides a type-safe way to handle errors without exceptions. It's the foundation for composable error handling throughout Evolu.

### 2. Task – Asynchronous operations

Learn [`Task`](/docs/api-reference/common/Task/interfaces/Task), which represents asynchronous computations in a lazy, composable way.

### 3. Type – Runtime validation

Understand the [`Type`](/docs/api-reference/common/Type) system for runtime validation and parsing. This enables you to enforce constraints at compile-time and validate untrusted data at runtime.

### 4. Dependency injection

Explore the [dependency injection pattern](/docs/dependency-injection) used throughout Evolu for decoupled, testable code.

### 5. Conventions

Review the [Evolu conventions](/docs/conventions) to understand the codebase style and patterns.

## Exploring the API

After understanding the core concepts, explore the full API in the [API reference](/docs/api-reference/common). All code is commented and test files are written to be read as examples—they demonstrate practical usage patterns and edge cases.
