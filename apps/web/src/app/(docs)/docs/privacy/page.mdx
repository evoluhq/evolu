# Privacy

Privacy is fundamental to local-first software, and Evolu takes it seriously. Unlike traditional client-server applications where data lives on someone else's servers, Evolu ensures that data remains under the user's complete control while providing the synchronization and backup benefits needed.

## End-to-end encryption by default

Everything in Evolu is encrypted end-to-end. This means:

- Data is stored in encrypted SQLite on the device
- Data is always encrypted when it leaves the device
- The Evolu Relay receives only encrypted data
- Only devices with the correct encryption keys can decrypt the data
- Even if someone intercepts the data in transit or gains access to the relay, they see only meaningless encrypted bytes

The encryption happens automatically—developers don't need to configure it, and users don't need to think about it.

## API design prevents data leaks

Evolu's API is designed to prevent developers from accidentally leaking sensitive data:

- **No public data options**: There is no API to mark data as "public" or "unencrypted"
- **No configuration required**: Developers cannot disable encryption or create security vulnerabilities through misconfiguration

## Traffic analysis protection

To prevent traffic analysis attacks, Evolu uses message padding (PADMÉ)—a [technique](https://lbarman.ch/blog/padme/) that pads binary messages to obscure their actual size. Combined with end-to-end encryption, this ensures that traffic analysis cannot reveal information about data or usage patterns.

## Relay blindness by design

The Evolu Relay is completely blind to user data. What the relay sees:

- **OwnerId**: A unique identifier for the data owner (but not who that owner is)
- **Timestamps**: When changes occurred (for synchronization ordering)
- **Encrypted binary blobs**: The actual data, completely encrypted and padded to obscure size
- **IP addresses**: Network addresses of connecting clients (standard for any network service unless using Tor or similar privacy networks)

The relay functions purely as a message buffer for synchronization and backup—it stores and forwards encrypted messages without any ability to decrypt, analyze, or understand them.

## Timestamp metadata & activity privacy

Relays and collaborators can see timestamps (user activity). This does not increase risk compared to any real‑time messaging system where traffic timing is observable.

### Why timestamps are visible

Real‑time communication inherently reveals that “something happened” (bytes were transferred). Even if we hid explicit timestamps, an observer could record packet timing. Relying on participants not to store this information is unsafe, so explicitly exposing timestamp metadata doesn't add additional risk.

### Mitigating activity leakage

If maximum privacy is required (e.g., hiding interaction cadence), an application can implement a local write queue:

1. Write changes immediately to a local‑only table
2. Periodically and randomly flush messages to sync tables

- **Trade-off:** It breaks real-time collaboration.

## Post-quantum resistance

### Evolu Relay

The Evolu Relay is post-quantum safe, so "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks (where adversaries collect encrypted data today to decrypt with future quantum computers) are not possible. Unlike public-key cryptography systems that use asymmetric encryption (which quantum computers could potentially break), the relay uses only symmetric encryption.

The Evolu Relay never sees or stores public keys—it only handles symmetrically encrypted data. Symmetric encryption algorithms are considered quantum-safe.

### Collaboration

For collaboration, asymmetric cryptography is required, and asymmetric cryptography can be vulnerable to quantum attacks. Detailed documentation will be provided soon.
