# Patterns

## Relations

Evolu is using [Kysely](https://kysely.dev), the type-safe SQL query builder
for TypeScript.

> Kysely IS NOT an ORM. Kysely DOES NOT have the concept of relations. Kysely IS a query builder. Kysely DOES build the SQL you tell it to, nothing more, nothing less.

However, there is a way to nest related rows in queries. It's described
[here](https://kysely.dev/docs/recipes/relations), and Evolu supports it.

TLDR: JSON type with subselects. With the combination of these two things,
we can write some super efficient queries with nested relations.
Evolu automatically parses stringified JSONs to typed objects. Evolu also ensures
that no strings can accidentally contain a stringified JSON.

  [example](https://www.evolu.dev/examples/nextjs) to see how each todo fetches
  its categories.

## Deferred Sync with Local-Only Tables

Tables with a name prefixed with `_` are local-only, which means they are never
synced. It's useful for device-specific or temporal data.

Imagine editing a JSON representing a rich-text formatted document. Syncing the
whole document on every change would be inefficient. The ideal solution could
be to use some advanced CRDT logic, for example, the
[Peritext](https://www.inkandswitch.com/peritext), but a reliable implementation
doesn't exist yet.

Fortunately, we can leverage Evolu's local-only tables instead. Saving huge
JSON on every keystroke isn't an issue because Evolu uses Web Workers,
so saving doesn't block the main thread. In React Native, we use
`InteractionManager.runAfterInteractions` (soon).

  Is postMessage slow? No, not really. (It depends.)

</Callout>

When we decide it's time to sync, we move data from the local-only table to the
regular table. There is no API for that; just set `isDeleted` to `true` and insert
data into a new table. Evolu batches mutations in microtask and runs it within a
transaction, so there is no chance for data loss.

```ts
// Both `update` and `create` run within a transaction.
evolu.update("_todo", { id: someId, isDeleted: true });
// This mutation starts syncing immediately.
evolu.create("todo", { title });
```

The last question is, when should we do that? We can expose an explicit sync
button, but that's not a friendly UX. The better approach is to use a reliable
heuristic to detect the user unit of work. We can leverage page visibility,
a route change, and other techniques. Unfortunately, we can't rely on unload
event because it's unreliable. **Evolu will release a helper for that soon.**

## JSON

SQLite supports JSON but stores and returns it as a stringified object.
Evolu automatically stringifies and parses JSON to improve DX.

```ts
const SomeJson = S.struct({ foo: S.string, bar: S.boolean });
type SomeJson = S.Schema.Type<typeof SomeJson>;

const TodoTable = table({
  id: TodoId,
  title: NonEmptyString1000,
  json: SomeJson,
});

// No need to call JSON.stringify
create("todo", { title, json: { foo: "a", bar: false } });

const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos);
// Evolu automatically parses JSONs into typed objects.
if (rows[0]) console.log(rows[0].json.foo);
```

<Callout>
  Evolu's automatic JSON string parsing is based on heuristics (if it looks like
  a stringified JSON, try to parse it). That means that any string that is a
  stringified JSON will be parsed. Use the Evolu `String` schema for all string
  columns to prevent a situation where the user stores stringified JSON in a
  regular string column. Check how `String1000` schema is made.
