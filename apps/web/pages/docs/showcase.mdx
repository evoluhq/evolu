# Showcase

## Evolu.me

[Evolu.me](https://evolu.me/) is a local-first calendar and notes I'm working on.
I want all my apps to be open-sourced and local-first, so I started with
a calendar and notes.

I often use a calendar for notes and notes as a calendar, so I suppose it
should be just one app. Apps are just artificial and arbitrary boundaries
within my data.

## Starpy

[Starpy](https://www.starpy.me/) is a P2P collaborative video editor and storage appâ€”a single app for cameraman, editor, and director.

## gider.im

[gider.im](https://gider.im/) is a simple, progressive web app (PWA) designed for those seeking a straightforward way to manage personal finances.
