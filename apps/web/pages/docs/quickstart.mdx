# Quickstart

Let's learn how to use Evolu in a few steps.

<Steps>
### Define Data

First, we define a database schema: tables, columns, and their types.

<Callout>
  Evolu uses [Schema](https://github.com/effect-ts/schema) for data modeling.
  Instead of plain JavaScript types like String or Number, we recommend [branded
  types](https://www.effect.website/docs/style/brands). With branded types, we
  can define and enforce domain rules like `NonEmptyString1000` or
  `PositiveInt`.
</Callout>

```ts
import * as S from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import {
  NonEmptyString1000,
  SqliteBoolean,
  createEvolu,
  id,
} from "@evolu/react";

const TodoId = id("Todo");
type TodoId = S.Schema.To<typeof TodoId>;

const TodoTable = S.struct({
  id: TodoId,
  title: NonEmptyString1000,
  isCompleted: SqliteBoolean,
});
type TodoTable = S.Schema.To<typeof TodoTable>;

const Database = S.struct({
  todo: TodoTable,
});
type Database = S.Schema.To<typeof Database>;

const evolu = createEvolu(Database);
```

TypeScript compiler ensures that the `title` can't be an arbitrary string.
It has to be parsed with the `NonEmptyString1000` schema. Isn't that beautiful?

### Parse Data

```ts
import * as S from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import { NonEmptyString1000 } from "@evolu/react";

S.parse(NonEmptyString1000)(title);
```

Learn more about [Schema](https://github.com/effect-ts/schema).
It's like [Zod](https://zod.dev), but faster and with better design.

### Mutate Data

While Evolu provides the full SQL for queries, the mutation API is tailored for
local-first apps to ensure changes can be merged without conflicts and to mitigate
the possibility that a developer accidentally makes unwanted changes—for example,
an update of all rows in a table. That would generate a lot of CRDT messages that
would have to be propagated to all other devices. It's not bad per se; it's just
something that shouldn't be necessary with proper database schema design.

```ts
// Without React
const { id } = evolu.create("todo", { title, isCompleted: false });
evolu.update("todo", { id, isCompleted: true }, () => {
  // done
});

// With React
const { create, update } = useEvolu<Database>();
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note there is no error handling because there is no reason why a mutation
  should fail. Types ensure correctness, and the local SQLite database is always
  available. DX of local-first apps is the next level.
</Callout>

### Query Data

Evolu uses type-safe TypeScript SQL query builder
[Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely), so autocompletion works
out-of-the-box. Let's start with a simple `Query`.

```ts
const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll());
```

Once we have a query, we can load or subscribe to it.

```ts
const promise = evolu.loadQuery(allTodos);
const unsubscribe = evolu.subscribeQuery(allTodos)(callback);
```

<Callout>
  Evolu provides React Hooks `useQuery` and `useQueries` with the full React
  Suspense support. For example, we can load a query in the root and use the
  returned promise elsewhere.
</Callout>

### Protect Data

Privacy is essential for Evolu, so all data are encrypted with an encryption key
derived from a safely generated cryptographically strong password called
[mnemonic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki).

```ts
// evolu.subscribeOwner
const owner = evolu.getOwner();
if (owner) owner.mnemonic;
```

### Delete Data

Leave no traces on a device.

```ts
if (confirm("Are you sure? It will delete all your local data."))
  evolu.resetOwner();
```

### Restore Data

Synced Evolu data can be restored with mnemonic on any device.

```ts
evolu.restoreOwner(mnemonic);
```

</Steps>

And that's all we need to know to work with Evolu. The minimal API is the key
to good DX.
