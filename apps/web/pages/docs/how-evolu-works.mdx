# How Evolu Works

Evolu is simple. That's the feature, not a bug. It's based on James Long's
[CRDTs for Mortals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEcwa68f-jY) talk.
I recommend you to watch it. James also made a
[working example](https://github.com/jlongster/crdt-example-app), and someone
very well [explained it](https://github.com/steida/crdt-example-app_annotated/blob/master/NOTES.md).
I took that code and improved it for production.

So, how does Evolu work? Evolu creates SQLite database in the user device and stores
all data locally. While we have full SQL for reads, writes must be written
in a special form to sync data among devices safely and without merge conflicts.
Every DB change is described as a CRDT message.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  CRDT stands for "Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type." It is a type of data
  structure used in distributed computing and distributed databases to enable
  concurrent updates to data without conflicts or the need for centralized
  coordination. CRDTs are designed to work in scenarios where multiple replicas
  of data exist in a distributed system, and these replicas can be updated
  independently and concurrently.
</Callout>

Evolu creates and stores CRDT messages locally and derives actual DB from them.
The most simple CRDT mutation (and the only one implemented right now) is the
last write win. A CRDT message contains a table, row, column, value, and timestamp
because every CRDT message has to have a timestamp to ensure globally stable ordering
via [hybrid logical clocks](https://jaredforsyth.com/posts/hybrid-logical-clocks/).

## How it really works?

Everything starts with a mutation, you can create or update a row.

```ts
const { create, update } = useMutation();

const { id } = create("todo", { title, isCompleted: false });
update("todo", { id, isCompleted: true });
```

Evolu uses `queueMicrotask` to make an array of `Mutation` to send
a batch to a WebWorker to not block the main thread.

```ts
export interface Mutation {
  readonly table: string;
  readonly id: Id;
  readonly values: Record.ReadonlyRecord<
    string,
    Value | Date | boolean | undefined
  >;
  readonly isInsert: boolean;
}
```

In the WebWorker, Evolu maps `Mutation` to `Message`.

```ts
export interface NewMessage {
  readonly table: string;
  readonly row: Id;
  readonly column: string;
  readonly value: Value;
}

export interface Message extends NewMessage {
  readonly timestamp: TimestampString;
}
```

Every `NewMessage` will get a `Timestamp` consisting of `NodeId`, `Millis`,
and `Counter`.

```ts
export interface Timestamp {
  readonly node: NodeId;
  readonly millis: Millis;
  readonly counter: Counter;
}
```

The timestamp is essential to ensure the same order of messages across
all devices. Every timestamp also has to be unique. That is guaranteed via
`NodeId` and `Counter`. Computer clocks are unreliable. They can accidentally
go backward or be the same. If such a situation happens, the later time is chosen,
and the counter is incremented. Check `sendTimestamp` function in `Timestamp.ts`.
We must store the last timestamp in the database to make a new one.

Now, we have an array of messages to update the local database via the
`applyMessages` function. The `applyMessages` function is also used for
messages we receive from other devices. We use the same logic for all
messages describing database changes to ensure messages are processed
always in the same manner.

The `applyMessages` function in the `Db.ts` stores messages in a
separate table and updates the database if a message is new. It's the
simple last-write-win approach. The `applyMessages` function also maintains
the Merkle tree, which is used to find the last timestamp when both the
local and remove Merkle trees are the same. Merkle tree is stored as
a "merkleized" prefix tree (trie).

After messages are processed, a sync loop is requested, and subscribed
queries are refreshed.

The sync loop compares Merkle trees until both local and remote devices are
in the same state. Received messages timestamps are processed via
the `receiveTimestamp` function.

And that's all. Take a look at the source code and check the tests. For a
more detailed description, read the links above.
