# create

`create` defines the database schema and returns React Hooks.
Evolu uses [Schema](https://github.com/effect-ts/schema) for domain modeling.

## Example

```ts
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import * as Evolu from "evolu";

const TodoId = Evolu.id("Todo");
type TodoId = Schema.To<typeof TodoId>;

const TodoTable = Schema.struct({
  id: TodoId,
  title: Evolu.NonEmptyString1000,
  isCompleted: Evolu.SqliteBoolean,
});
type TodoTable = Schema.To<typeof TodoTable>;

const Database = Schema.struct({
  todo: TodoTable,
});

export const {
  useQuery,
  useMutation,
  useEvoluError,
  useOwner,
  useOwnerActions,
} = Evolu.create(Database);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  There is one simple rule for local-first apps domain modeling: After the
  initial release, models shall be append-only.
</Callout>

Tables and columns shall not be removed because there is a possibility
that somebody is already using them. Column types shall be enriched only.

With this simple rule, any app version can handle any schema version.
Evolu database is schemaless and doesn't have to be migrated when
a schema is changed. Migrations are not feasible for local-first apps.

If an obsolete app gets a sync message with a newer schema, Evolu
automatically updates the database schema to store the message safely,
and `useQuery` filterMap helper will ignore unknown rows until
the app is updated.

To learn more about migration-less schema evolving, check the `useQuery`
documentation.
