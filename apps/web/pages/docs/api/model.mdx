# Model

## Id

Branded Id Schema for any table Id.
To create Id Schema for a specific table, use `id`.

## id

A factory function to create `Id` Schema for a specific table.

### Example

```ts
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import * as Evolu from "@evolu/react";

const TodoId = Evolu.id("Todo");
type TodoId = Schema.Schema.To<typeof TodoId>;

if (!Schema.is(TodoId)(value)) return;
```

## Mnemonic

Mnemonic is a password generated by Evolu in BIP39 format.

A mnemonic, also known as a "seed phrase," is a set of 12 words in a
specific order chosen from a predefined list. The purpose of the BIP39
mnemonic is to provide a human-readable way of storing a private key.

## OwnerId

The unique identifier of `Owner` safely derived from its `Mnemonic`.

## Owner

`Owner` represents the Evolu database owner. Evolu auto-generates `Owner` on
the first run. `Owner` can be reset on the current device and restored
on a different one.

## SqliteBoolean

SQLite doesn't support the boolean type, so Evolu uses `SqliteBoolean` instead.
Use the `cast` helper to cast `SqliteBoolean` from boolean and back.

## SqliteDate

SQLite doesn't support the Date type, so Evolu uses `SqliteDate` instead.
Use the `cast` helper to cast `SqliteDate` from Date and back.

## cast

A helper for casting types not supported by SQLite.
SQLite doesn't support Date nor Boolean types, so Evolu emulates them
with `SqliteBoolean` and `SqliteDate`.

### Example

```ts
// isDeleted is SqliteBoolean
.where("isDeleted", "is not", cast(true))
```

## String1000

A string with a maximum length of 1000 characters.

### Example

```ts
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import * as Evolu from "@evolu/react";

if (!Schema.is(Evolu.String1000)(value)) return;
function foo(value: Evolu.String1000) {}
```

## NonEmptyString1000

A nonempty string with a maximum length of 1000 characters.

### Example

```ts
import * as Schema from "@effect/schema/Schema";
import * as Evolu from "@evolu/react";

if (!Schema.is(Evolu.NonEmptyString1000)(value)) return;
function foo(value: Evolu.NonEmptyString1000) {}
```
