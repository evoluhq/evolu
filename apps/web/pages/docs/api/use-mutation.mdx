# useMutation

`useMutation` React Hook returns an object with two functions for creating
and updating rows in the database.

Note that Evolu does not use SQL for mutations. It's not a bug; it's a
feature. SQL for mutations is dangerous for local-first apps. One update
can affect all rows. Local-first data are meant to last forever.
Imagine an SQL update that changes tons of data. That would generate
a lot of sync messages making sync slow and backup huge.

Explicit mutations also allow Evolu to automatically add and update
a few useful columns common to all tables. Those columns are:
`createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `isDeleted`.

## create

Creates a new row with the given values.

### Examples

To create a new row:

```ts
const { create } = useMutation();
create("todo", { title });
```

To get a new row's `Id`:

```ts
const { create } = useMutation();
const { id } = create("todo", { title });
```

To wait until a new row is rendered:

```ts
const { create } = useMutation();
create("todo", { title }, onComplete);
```

## update

Update a row with the given values.

### Examples

To update a row:

```ts
const { update } = useMutation();
update("todo", { id, title });
```

To wait until the updated row is rendered:

```ts
const { update } = useMutation();
update("todo", { id, title }, onComplete);
```

To delete a row.

```ts
const { update } = useMutation();
update("todo", { id, isDeleted: true });
```
