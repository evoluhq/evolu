# useQuery

`useQuery` React Hook performs a database query and returns `rows` and
`row` props that are automatically updated when data changes. It
takes two callbacks, a [Kysely](https://github.com/koskimas/kysely)
type-safe SQL query builder, and a `filterMap` helper for rows filtering
and ad-hoc migrations.

## Examples

The most simple example:

```ts
const { rows } = useQuery((db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll());
```

If you mouse hover over `rows`, you will see that all columns except `Id`
are nullable regardless of the database Schema.

There are two good reasons for that. The first is the local-first app
database schema can be changed anytime, but already-created data can't
because it's not feasible to migrate all local data. The second reason
is that sync messages can arrive in any order in distributed systems.

The remedy for nullability is ad-hoc filtering and mapping via `filterMap`
helper. This example filters out rows with falsy titles:

```ts
const { rows } = useQuery(
  (db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll(),
  ({ title, ...rest }) => title && { title, ...rest },
);
```

A real app would `filterMap` all versions of the table schema defined
by a union of types, therefore safely enforced by the TypeScript compiler.

The next example shows the usage of columns that Evolu automatically
adds to all tables. Those columns are: `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, and `isDeleted`.

```ts
const { rows } = useQuery(
  (db) =>
    db
      .selectFrom("todoCategory")
      .select(["id", "name"])
      .where("isDeleted", "is not", Evolu.cast(true))
      .orderBy("createdAt"),
  ({ name, ...rest }) => name && { name, ...rest },
);
```

Note `Evolu.cast` usage. It's Evolu's helper to cast booleans and dates
that SQLite does not support natively.
