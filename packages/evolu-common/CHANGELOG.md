## 1.0.14

### Patch Changes

- 242d7e5: Experimental new feature: Local only tables

  A local-only table is a table prefixed with "\_" that will never be syncedâ€”a small but handy addition. Imagine editing huge JSON. Should we store it on any change or allow the user to "commit" data later? In an ideal world, we would have CRDT abstraction for any data, and we will have, but for now, we can postpone or even cancel sync with local-only tables. Another use-case is device-only data, for example, some settings that should not be shared with other devices. Local-only tables also allow real deletion. Use the isDeleted common column and the row will be deleted instead of marked as deleted.

## 1.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 8f7c8c8: Dedupe messages created within the microtask queue

  That's only for a case where someone accidentally calls mutate with the same values repeatedly. There is no reason to create identical messages.

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 44caee5: Update deps
- 44caee5: Ensure valid device clock and Timestamp time.

  Millis represents a time that is valid for usage with the Merkle tree. It must be between Apr 13, 1997, and Nov 05, 2051, to ensure MinutesBase3 length equals 16. We can find diff for two Merkle trees only within this range. If the device clock is out of range, Evolu will not store data until it's fixed.
