## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- bc18e74: Add the sync function

  Evolu syncs on every mutation, tab focus, and network reconnect, so it's generally not required to sync manually, but if you need it, you can do it.

  ```ts
  evolu.sync();
  ```

### Major Changes

- 7e80483: New API

  With the upcoming React 19 `use` Hook, I took a chance to review and improve the Evolu API. I moved as many logic and types as possible to the Evolu interface to make platform variants more lightweight and to allow the use of Evolu directly out of any UI library.

  The most significant change is the split of SQL query declaration and usage. The rest of the API is almost identical except for minor improvements and one removal: filterMap helper is gone.

  It was a good idea with a nice DX, but such ad-hoc migrations belong in the database, not the JavaScript code. Filtering already loaded data pulls excessive data that should stay in the database. The good news is we can do that and even better with Kysely.

  To refresh what we are talking about for Evolu newcomers. Because database schema is evolving, and we can't do classical migrations in local-first apps (because we don't delete and other CRDT stuff), Evolu adopted GraphQL schema-less everything-is-nullable pattern.

  Having nullable everywhere in code is not ideal DX, so it would be nice to filter, ensure non-nullability, and even map rows directly in the database. Surprisingly, SQL is capable of that. Expect Evolu DSL for that soon. Meanwhile, we can do that manually:

  ```ts
  const todosWithout = evolu.createQuery((db) =>
    db
      .selectFrom("todo")
      .select(["id", "title", "isCompleted", "categoryId"])
      .where("isDeleted", "is not", Evolu.cast(true))
      // Filter null value and ensure non-null type. Evolu will provide a helper.
      .where("title", "is not", null)
      .$narrowType<{ title: Evolu.NonEmptyString1000 }>()
      .orderBy("createdAt"),
  );
  ```

  And now to the new API. Behold:

  ```ts
  // Create queries.
  const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll());
  const todoById = (id: TodoId) =>
    evolu.createQuery((db) =>
      db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll().where("id", "=", id),
    );

  // We can load a query or many queries.
  const allTodosPromise = evolu.loadQuery(allTodos).then(({ rows }) => {
    console.log(rows);
  });
  evolu.loadQueries([allTodos, todoById(1)]);

  // useQuery can load once or use a promise.
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos);
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos, { once: true });
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos, { promise: allTodosPromise });
  const { row } = useQuery(todoById(1));
  ```

  I also refactored (read: simplified) the usage of Effect Layers across all libraries. And the last thing: There is no breaking change in data storage or protocol.

## 1.0.14

### Patch Changes

- 242d7e5: Experimental new feature: Local only tables

  A local-only table is a table prefixed with "\_" that will never be syncedâ€”a small but handy addition. Imagine editing huge JSON. Should we store it on any change or allow the user to "commit" data later? In an ideal world, we would have CRDT abstraction for any data, and we will have, but for now, we can postpone or even cancel sync with local-only tables. Another use-case is device-only data, for example, some settings that should not be shared with other devices. Local-only tables also allow real deletion. Use the isDeleted common column and the row will be deleted instead of marked as deleted.

## 1.0.13

- 9d319e5: Rename canUseDOM to canUseDom

- 094e25a: Expose and leverage canUseDOM

## 1.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 8f7c8c8: Dedupe messages created within the microtask queue

  That's only for a case where someone accidentally calls mutate with the same values repeatedly. There is no reason to create identical messages.

## 1.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 44caee5: Update deps
- 44caee5: Ensure valid device clock and Timestamp time.

  Millis represents a time that is valid for usage with the Merkle tree. It must be between Apr 13, 1997, and Nov 05, 2051, to ensure MinutesBase3 length equals 16. We can find diff for two Merkle trees only within this range. If the device clock is out of range, Evolu will not store data until it's fixed.
