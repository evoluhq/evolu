  It was a silly typo; sorry about that. Ironically, tests didn't catch it because that was the one test I didn't port after refactoring. My bad. We will add more tests in the future.

### Major Changes

- d156e67: Multitenancy, stable Effect, refactoring, logging

  Greetings. I spent the last few weeks refactoring Evolu. There are no breaking changes except for one function name. It's a major change because with such a significant refactoring, I can't be 100 % sure I didn't break anything. The core logic remains unchanged, but Evolu uses the Effect library better. When Evolu started with Effect, the website didn't exist yet.

  The initial reason for refactoring Evolu was that I wasn't satisfied with the Web Workers wrapper. I tried Comlink. It's a great library, but it has flaws, as documented in a new ProxyWorker, a lightweight Comlink tailored for Effect. While Effect provides an excellent wrapper for workers, I wanted to try a Comlink-like API. Such a change was a chance to review how Evolu uses Effect, and I realized I used too many Layers for no reason.

  During refactoring, I realized it would be nice if Evolu could run more instances concurrently. So, Evolu now supports multitenancy ðŸ™‚.

  I wasn't satisfied with the initial data definition, so I added an API for that, too. And logging. If you are curious about what's happening within Evolu, try the new `minimumLogLevel` Config option. There are also a few minor improvements inside the core logic.Â Again, there are no breaking changes;Â it is just better and more readable source code.

  The great news is that Effect is stable now, so there will be no more releases with deps updates. Let's dance ðŸª©

  New features:

  - Multitenancy (we can run more Evolu instances side by side)
  - Initial data (to define fixtures)
  - Logging (you can see what's happening inside Evolu step by step)
  - Faster and safer DB access (we use shared transactions for reads and special "last" transaction mode for resetting)
  - Stable Effect ðŸŽ‰

- 30d2a40: `createIndex` replaced with `createIndexes`

  That's why it's a breaking changeâ€”a slight change in API. Everything else is backward compatible. Evolu is stable for many major versions.

### Minor Changes

- 69bcf80: Update the minimal TypeScript version to 5.4

## 4.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a0d1e3c: Add config logSql option
- 0afb614: Update Effect and Schema

## 4.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 8af071c: Indexes (or indices, we don't judge)

  This release brings SQLite indexes support to Evolu with two helpful options for `evolu.createQuery` functions.

  ```ts
  const indexes = [
    createIndex("indexTodoCreatedAt").on("todo").column("createdAt"),
  ];

  const evolu = createEvolu(Database, {
    // Try to remove/re-add indexes with `logExplainQueryPlan`.
    indexes,
  });

  const allTodos = evolu.createQuery(
    (db) => db.selectFrom("todo").orderBy("createdAt").selectAll(),
    {
      logExecutionTime: true,
      // logExplainQueryPlan: false,
    },
  );
  ```

  Indexes are not necessary for development but are required for production.

  Before adding an index, use `logExecutionTime` and `logExplainQueryPlan`
  createQuery options.

  SQLite has [a tool](https://sqlite.org/cli.html#index_recommendations_sqlite_expert_) for index recommendations.

### Patch Changes

- 1f9168f: Fix SSR

  Evolu server-side rendering was surprisingly problematic because of the React Suspense error: "This Suspense boundary received an update before it finished hydrating."

  If you are curious why a local-first library needs to render something on the server where there is no data, the answer is that if we can render empty rows, we should.

  But because of the React Suspense error, Evolu apps had to be wrapped by the ClientOnly component, which wasn't ideal. Check article:

  https://tkdodo.eu/blog/avoiding-hydration-mismatches-with-use-sync-external-store

  Internally, PlatformName has been replaced with useWasSSR React Hook.

## 4.0.1

### Patch Changes

- aa06cbe: Allow using Kysely `with` and `withRecursive`

  And throw on forbidden SQL mutations.

## 4.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2fe4e16: Add Config name property and remove LocalStorage support.

  It's a breaking change only because PlatformName was restricted. There is no change in sync protocol so that all data can be safely restored.

## 3.0.6

### Patch Changes

- 1b4e331: Update Effect and Schema peer dependencies

  If you are curious why Effect and Schema peer dependencies must be updated on every release, the reason is that Effect isn't version 2 yet. Hence, it must be pinned to the same version.

  ```ts
  const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll());
  type AllTodosRow = ExtractRow<typeof allTodos>;
  ```

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- d289ac7: Improve table and database schema DX.

  In the previous Evolu version, table and database schemas were created with `S.struct` and validated with createEvolu. Because of how the TypeScript compiler works, type errors were incomprehensible.

  We added two new helper functions to improve a DX: `table` and `database`.

  Previous schema definition:

  ```ts
  const TodoTable = S.struct({
    id: TodoId,
    title: NonEmptyString1000,
  });
  const Database = S.struct({
    todo: TodoTable,
  });
  ```

  New schema definition:

  ```ts
  const TodoTable = table({
    id: TodoId,
    title: NonEmptyString1000,
  });
  const Database = database({
    todo: TodoTable,
  });
  ```

  Those two helpers also detect missing ID columns and the usage of reserved columns.

  This update is a breaking change because reserved columns (createdAt, updatedAt, isDeleted) are created with `table` function now.

  evolu.sync();
  ```

### Major Changes

- 7e80483: New API

  With the upcoming React 19 `use` Hook, I took a chance to review and improve the Evolu API. I moved as many logic and types as possible to the Evolu interface to make platform variants more lightweight and to allow the use of Evolu directly out of any UI library.

  The most significant change is the split of SQL query declaration and usage. The rest of the API is almost identical except for minor improvements and one removal: filterMap helper is gone.

  It was a good idea with a nice DX, but such ad-hoc migrations belong in the database, not the JavaScript code. Filtering already loaded data pulls excessive data that should stay in the database. The good news is we can do that and even better with Kysely.

  To refresh what we are talking about for Evolu newcomers. Because database schema is evolving, and we can't do classical migrations in local-first apps (because we don't delete and other CRDT stuff), Evolu adopted GraphQL schema-less everything-is-nullable pattern.

  Having nullable everywhere in code is not ideal DX, so it would be nice to filter, ensure non-nullability, and even map rows directly in the database. Surprisingly, SQL is capable of that. Expect Evolu DSL for that soon. Meanwhile, we can do that manually:

  ```ts
  const todosWithout = evolu.createQuery((db) =>
    db
      .selectFrom("todo")
      .select(["id", "title", "isCompleted", "categoryId"])
      .where("isDeleted", "is not", Evolu.cast(true))
      // Filter null value and ensure non-null type. Evolu will provide a helper.
      .where("title", "is not", null)
      .$narrowType<{ title: Evolu.NonEmptyString1000 }>()
      .orderBy("createdAt"),
  );
  ```

  And now to the new API. Behold:

  ```ts
  // Create queries.
  const allTodos = evolu.createQuery((db) => db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll());
  const todoById = (id: TodoId) =>
    evolu.createQuery((db) =>
      db.selectFrom("todo").selectAll().where("id", "=", id),
    );

  // We can load a query or many queries.
  const allTodosPromise = evolu.loadQuery(allTodos).then(({ rows }) => {
    console.log(rows);
  });
  evolu.loadQueries([allTodos, todoById(1)]);

  // useQuery can load once or use a promise.
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos);
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos, { once: true });
  const { rows } = useQuery(allTodos, { promise: allTodosPromise });
  const { row } = useQuery(todoById(1));
  ```

  I also refactored (read: simplified) the usage of Effect Layers across all libraries. And the last thing: There is no breaking change in data storage or protocol.

## 1.0.14

### Patch Changes

- 242d7e5: Experimental new feature: Local only tables

  A local-only table is a table prefixed with "\_" that will never be syncedâ€”a small but handy addition. Imagine editing huge JSON. Should we store it on any change or allow the user to "commit" data later? In an ideal world, we would have CRDT abstraction for any data, and we will have, but for now, we can postpone or even cancel sync with local-only tables. Another use-case is device-only data, for example, some settings that should not be shared with other devices. Local-only tables also allow real deletion. Use the isDeleted common column and the row will be deleted instead of marked as deleted.

  Millis represents a time that is valid for usage with the Merkle tree. It must be between Apr 13, 1997, and Nov 05, 2051, to ensure MinutesBase3 length equals 16. We can find diff for two Merkle trees only within this range. If the device clock is out of range, Evolu will not store data until it's fixed.
