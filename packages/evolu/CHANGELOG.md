- f70280d: New evolu.world sync&backup server and new useSyncState React Hook

  A lot of time was spent considering the ideal Evolu sync&backup server architecture. While the evolu-server package is okay, it's sure that one server can't scale for global usage. Evolu is going to be used with SatoshiLabs Trezor, a hardware Bitcoin wallet, and they have already sold over 1 million devices. It's clear Evolu needs something that scales. And as the domain suggests, there should be no regions, only one global endpoint. We initially designed a network of many replicated SQLite nodes spread worldwide, then realized that's exactly what Cloudflare is working on. That's why the new evolu.world sync&backup server is built on top of Cloudflare D1. Note that evolu.world is beta, just like Cloudflare D1 is.

  The new evolu.world sync&backup server is free for anyone but restricts the size of user data to 1 MB. It's not a final decision, just a number to start with. The idea is to provide syncing for free to anyone with up to 1 MB of data and make money on backups. Because of the unique account-less Evolu design, it's easy to attack the service but also easy for Evolu to protect itself. Suspicious accounts can be deleted anytime without losing user data, they are still stored locally on devices, and syncing will still work if we accidentally delete a real user.

  To monitor the sync state, Evolu provides a new useSyncState React Hook.

- c7f5182: React Suspense

  [It's about time](https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1654171173582692353). React Suspense is an excellent React feature that massively improves both UX and DX. It's a breaking change because I decided to remove the `isLoading` and `isLoaded` states entirely. It's not necessary anymore. Use React Suspense.

  Implementing and testing React Suspense also led to internal optimizations for faster and more reliable syncing and better unit tests.

  This release also includes SQLite 3.42.0. There is no breaking change in data persistence.

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- 590d5a8: Port Evolu from fp-ts to Effect

  Nothing changed except Evolu is internally using [Effect](https://www.effect.website) instead of fp-ts now. Because of that, I refactored all source code hence a major change.

  Effect is [the successor](https://dev.to/effect-ts/a-bright-future-for-effect-455m) of fp-ts. If you already know fp-ts, you will understand it quickly. If you don't know fp-ts yet, skip it, and learn Effect instead. Give it five minutes, and you will love it.

  The devil's advocate question: Could Evolu be written without Effect? It could be, but the source code would be uglier, brittle, and slower. Let me explain it. For now, Evolu is using a synchronous version of SQLite. But soon, we will also use asynchronous SQLite for other platforms where synchronous SQLite is not available. With Effect, the code is the same. Without Effect, we would always use Promises, even for synchronous code. Or we would have to write the same logic twice. As for brittle code, Effect catches and can recover from all errors. As for uglier code, errors we can expect are typed. And much more. I believe Effect will be the next big thing in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- 11f1a40: Better and more versatile encryption

  For the upcoming integration of Evolu with Trezor (a cryptographic hardware wallet developed by SatoshiLabs), we changed the owner id and encryption key derivation to use SLIP-21 (hierarchical derivation of symmetric keys).

  As a result, the existing owner will get a new id and encryption key, requiring all data to be re-sync. Evolu provides automatic migration for these breaking changes, so no further actions are needed.

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2f0a596: Evolu 2.0

  - Zod replaced with effect-ts/schema.
  - Types are more strict, readable, fast, reusable, and descriptive for the domain model. We also simplified type hints in IDEs.
  - The `mutate` function was replaced with the `create` and `update` functions.
  - We removed internals from public API.
  - Evolu enforces the useQuery `filterMap` helper usage because it's super-useful.

  We removed internals from public API because exporting all under the same namespace wasn't ideal for DX. If necessary, we will reexport them but namespaced. If you already have an app made with Evolu, the only breaking changes are in the API; the persistence remains the same.

  We replaced Zod with Schema because Schema is fantastic and going to be even better. Let me explain it. There are several well-established runtime type checkers in the TypeScript ecosystem. The best was io-ts from Giulio Canti, but during its further development, Giulio hit the wall of architectural design. After a few attempts, it looked like he had given up. Then Zod was created to continue the mission of the best runtime types checker. That's why Evolu chose Zod. Zod is good. But several months ago, Giulio Canti restarted its open-source work and joined his endeavor with the Effect team to work full-time on Schema and other awesome libs. While fresh new, Schema is already very powerful and faster than Zod. It's also very well documented. Evolu has big plans with type-driven development, and Schema is ideal.

  Switching to Schema allowed us to improve Evolu DX by making types more strict, readable, fast, reusable, and descriptive for the domain model. Before this change, every column except for Id was nullable. Evolu 2.0 makes nullability explicit and optional. That's why the `mutate` function was refactored to the `create` and `update` functions. The `create` function enforces non-nullable columns now. To leverage this feature, use TypeScript 4.7 or newer with strict and exactOptionalPropertyTypes flags enabled in your tsconfig.json file.

  The last change is that Evolu enforces useQuery `filterMap` usage. While Evolu enforces creating new rows with the desired Schema, it can't enforce the order of messages from other devices. That's a rule in distributed systems and local-first software: messages can and will come in any order. Also, local-first apps have to handle all schema versions gracefully. That's what `filterMap` is for.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- ec3755a: Switch to the official sqlite3 WASM client with a friendly MIT license

  Evolu no longer uses IndexedDB for persisting sqlite3 files. Instead, it uses modern Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) in Chrome and good old LocalStorage in other browsers.

  The LocalStorage implementation leverages VFS, so it doesn't load and save whole files. In other words, it's fast enough. The only limit is LocalStorage max size (5MB), which is sufficient unless a lot of data are stored.

  The Origin-Private FileSystem (OPFS) is currently supported only in Chrome, but both Safari and Firefox are finishing their support. Meanwhile, Evolu is using LocalStorage.

  We recommend Chrome OPFS Explorer extension to download the sqlite3 file.

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c171392: Run mutate onComplete after React flushSync

  Using mutate onComplete is rare because Evolu updates active queries automatically. We need onComplete typically when dealing with DOM, for example, moving focus for keyboard navigation. For such cases, onComplete must be called when DOM is already updated, and this update ensures it via React flushSync.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- abad8f5: Purge cache on a mutation

  Before this change, Evolu cached all queries forever. Caching forever is not a real issue because, sooner or later, users will reload the tab or browser itself. But UX could have been better. Imagine a situation when a user goes from page A to page B and then back. Without a mutation, everything is OK, and the user will see the valid data from the cache. But when a mutation is made, obsolete data will flash for milliseconds. While this is OK for server-loaded data (better stale than dead), there is absolutely no reason to favor stale over actual data for local-first apps because fetching is super fast and will never fail.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- e193754: Replace rfc6902 and immutable-json-patch with custom and much faster algorithm.

  For now, we detect only a change in the whole result and in-place edits. In the future, we will add more heuristics. We will probably not implement the Myers diff algorithm because it's faster to rerender all than to compute many detailed patches. We will only implement a logic a developer would implement manually, if necessary.
