# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Evolu, please help keep the project secure by disclosing it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/evoluhq/evolu/security/advisories/new) feature.

### Response Time

As this project is maintained by a single volunteer, please be patient.

## Security Considerations

### Important Notice

While Evolu is developed with care, please note:

- This is a volunteer-maintained project
- It has NOT undergone professional security audits yet
- Use in production or security-critical contexts is at your own risk

## Disclosure Policy

When a vulnerability is confirmed:

1. A fix will be developed privately
2. A new version will be released with the fix
3. The vulnerability will be disclosed in the release notes after users have had time to upgrade

For non-security issues, please use GitHub Issues.
